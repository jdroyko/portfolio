<h1>Portfolio</h1>

## Usage

This homework did not come with a starter code and therefore had to be started from scratch. I utilized Homework 1 <i>(see horiseon-accessibility repository)</i> for the framework of the HTML and CSS.

Then I drafted a Mock Up of how I want my page to look like. 

 *As an example this is how I wanted my About Me Section to look like with the Nav Bar  frozen in display*

### User Story

*AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position*

#### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

Acceptance Criteria expanded:

- Navigation bar on the right hand side

- The work section states under consturction because there are currently no applications that are avaible to browse through. This will be updated as projects come along and applications are launched.  
  
  - per the Acceptance Criteria the Under Construction portions are scaled 1.5 when they are hovered upon. 
  
  - WHEN clicked, they lead to a blank page.
